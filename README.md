## Preprocessing Data

Our main goal is to classify waste items into three distinct categories: 
* Landfill: Items that are non-recyclable or non-compostable and should be disposed of in landfills. 
* Recyclable: Items that can be recycled, such as plastics, metals, glass, and paper products.
* Compost: Items that can decompose and be used as compost.  

As a preprocessing step, we plan on combining the existing 30 waste categories into these broader categories. Additionally, we plan on converting the categorical labels into a numerical format with one-hot encoding
