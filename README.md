# CSE151A Project
## Introduction

Effective waste management is essential to environmental health. Improper waste management contributes to pollution, the spread of disease, contamination, ecosystem degradation, and worsened climate change. A key step in waste management starts by properly identifying waste as recyclable, landfill, or compost. However, due to the barrier of improper identification of waste items and non-immediate consequences, people often dispose of waste in the wrong containers. Our project applies machine learning-based image classification techniques to automate the identification and sorting of waste into landfill, recyclable, or compost categories. This will improve waste management by automating the sorting process, increasing accuracy, and preventing items like recyclables from being incorrectly sent to landfills. In the long-term, we hope that projects like ours enhance waste management systems, minimize environmental harm, and contribute to the development of a more sustainable future.

## Methods

### Data Exploration

The dataset has 15,000 pictures of waste classified as plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, organic waste, and textiles intercepted already in a landfill environment. This will help the accuracy of our model since it is devoid of surrounding trash. The plots and results from data exploration can be seen below:

- Number of classes: 30
- Number of images: 15000
- Unique image sizes: [(256, 256)]
- Number of images per class: 500

The distribution of image sizes showing that each image was 256 by 256 pixels:
